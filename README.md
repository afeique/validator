This is a simple PHP class for quickly validating form inputs using method chaining.

Requires my [error class](https://github.com/afeique/error) to be called via `include()` or `require()` beforehand.

## comments
* Usage information will be added at a later date.
* Classes are not enclosed in a namespace which may lead to conflicts; user discretion is advised.
* This github repository was created with the express purpose of helping me with versioning control across multiple projects that use the same code.
